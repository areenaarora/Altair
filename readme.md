## Goal
To learn Altair, a Python library for data visualization. I'm documenting my notes here plus some practice charts!

### How to naviagte the repository:
The chapter notebooks should be accessed sequentially. There are detailed comments to help you walk through my notebooks.

In the sample charts folder, I have thrown in a couple of starter charts from dummy datasets as included in Altair's documentation. [There's a whole bunch of them](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html) and I just threw in a couple I found the most interesting — will add more!

I'm also working to create a practice folder with other datastes not included in the vega library.
